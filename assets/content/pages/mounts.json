Katie brought Levander home as a 2 year old. He is the first horse, she has had solely to train for herself since a teenager. Since he was un-started, he is a clean slate to work with, and also the one that she can have the complete Journey with - to train, learn together, and bring up the levels, with aspirations to FEI and beyond.\n\nKatie has put all the foundational groundwork, in-hand training, and riding on Levander. Since starting Levander, she has also worked closely with Jeremy Steinberg to ensure that Levander has a solid, Classical Dressage Foundation. Levander is a demonstration of Katie's methodical, Classical System to give young horses a strong foundation right from the beginning. \n\nKatie is deliberately taking her time with Levander to mold him psychologically and physically. \n\n![](/img/85181952_789719214843820_9185985360155377664_n.jpg)",
