Katie brought Levander home as a 2 year old. He is the first horse, she has had all to herself since a teenager.Since he was un-started, he is a clean slate to work with, and also the one that she can have the complete Journey with - to train, learn together, and bring up the levels, with aspirations to FEI and beyond.\n\nKatie has put all the foundational groundwork, in-hand training, and riding on Levander. Since starting Levander, she has also worked closely with Jeremy Steinberg to ensure that Levander has the best Classical Dressage Foundation possible. Through this journey, Katie has also learned a methodical system to start young horses, which can be demonstrated by how correct and well Levander is going.\n\nThere is no absolutely no rush to Levanderâ€™s training to compete, as we are taking our time with him to artfully mold him psychologically and physically.",
