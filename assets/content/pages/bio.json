  "body": "Katie Erpel, brings a lifetime’s worth of knowledge to her training. Having grown up on a horse farm with a mother that's also a trainer, Katie was able to ride before she could walk. Training and riding comes second nature to her.\n\nKatie began working with FEI dressage trainers at the age of 10. Throughout her teenage years, she trained and competed in Young Riders, and went to Germany as a teenager to further her Classical Dressage theory knowledge.\n\nKatie graduated from Georgia State University with two Bachelor Degrees in German and Spanish with a concentration in International Business. During college, she returned to study and ride in Germany. She also worked as Trainer’s Assistant at After the Fox Farm for Roel Theunissen, Adam Lastowka, and Sandy Osborn.\n\nAfter a few years of working a “normal job”, Katie re-discovered that her life’s passion lies in Dressage. Since then, she has committed her life and career to pursuing her goals of becoming a renowned FEI Competitor, Trainer, and Instructor.\n\nKatie firmly believes that in order to be a great teacher and trainer, one must never stop learning, and continually invest in their own education, as well. In the past years, she has been consistently training and clinicing with many very exciting FEI Grand Prix Trainers such as:\n\n* Lisa Wilcox\n* Liz Austin\n* Madeline Austin\n* Sandy Osborn\n* Lyndon Rife\n* Stacy Hastings\n* Katie Poag\n* Shawna Harding\n* Natalie Lamping\n* Alison Head\n* Jermey Steinberg\n\nAt the moment, Katie has big dreams for her young horse, and is continuing her education in Aiken, SC and works closely with Former USEF, Youth Coach - Jeremy Steinberg, along with riding in clinics with FEI Trainers and Judges."
